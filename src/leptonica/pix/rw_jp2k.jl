  * `quality` - Must be in the range `1` to `100`.

__Details:__

**This method is meant for internal use only.**  It returns the memory pointer and number of bytes
allocated by the Leptonica library to write out the image.  The caller is responsible for freeing
this memory with a call to `lept_free()`.

For the `quality` parameter, `34` is usually considered a good default value.  A setting of `100`
would generate a lossless image.

If levels is `1` then only a full resolution image is encoded in the file.  A value of `2` would
cause a full resolution image and half resolution image to be encoded.  Often this value is set to
`5` so that images with a reduction factor of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 are encoded in the file.

Leptonica restricts he number of levels to less than or equal to 10.  However imperical tests show
that any value over 8 fails in the OpenJpeg library.
