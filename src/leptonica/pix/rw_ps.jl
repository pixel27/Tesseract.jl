Write an image to memory as a PostScript file. If there is an error `(C_NULL, 0)` is returned.

__Arguments:__

| T | Name     | Default  | Description
|:--| :------- | :------- | :----------
| R | pix      |          | The image to write to memory.
| R | box      |          | Optional location to have the image appear on the page.
| R | ppi      |          | The resolution to use for the image.
| R | scale    |          | Scale the image on the page.

__Restrictions:__

  * `ppi` - Must be greater than 0.
  * `scale` - Must be greater than or equal to `0.0`.

__Details:__

**This method is meant for internal use only.**  It returns the memory pointer and number of bytes
allocated by the Leptonica library to write out the image.  The caller is responsible for freeing
this memory with a call to `lept_free()`.

If you don't want the image scaled set the `scale` to `1.0`.  If you want to position the image on
the page you can use a `box` however set `w` and `h` to `0`, then the image will be positioned
where you want it and not scaled.

If you want the image to be a specific size set the scale to `0.0` and use a box setting `w` and
`h` to the width and height you want in thousandth of an inch.  So a width of `5000` and a height of
`2000` will give you an image that is 5 inches across and 2 inches high.

If you want the image scaled set the `scale` to the factor you desire.  Value of `0.5` will cause
the image to be halfed, while a value of `2.0` will double the size of the image.  If you want to
also position the image on the page use a `box` but set the `w` and `h` values to `0`.
