__Details:__

This is the primary function of the `TessPipeline` object.  This method is used to combine
output from multiple images into a single document (or multiple documents of different
types).

The argument passed back to the function is a method with the form:

    function add(Pix, Integer)::Bool

The client calls this method with the image and pixels per inch of the image.  The image
will be processed immediately and added to the pipeline's output.

If you the callback returns false then the `tess_run_pipeline()` will return `false`.  If it
doesn't return a boolean or returns `true` then `tess_run_pipeline()` returns `true`
assuming there are no other errors.

This method can only be used "once".  After it's called new output needs to be added to the
pipeline if you want to reuse the [`TessPipeline`](@ref) object.

```jldoctest
using Tesseract
